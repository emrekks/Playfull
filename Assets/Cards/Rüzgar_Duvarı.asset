  dialogue: Meteorologists expect windstorms to occur soon and recommend that we
    build a wind wall along the sides of highways. They state that if there is a
    wind storm occurs, it can prevent a possible road closure by blocking the dust
    that will come to the road. Shall we build a wind wall?
