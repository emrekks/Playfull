  dialogue: A businessman came from the metropolis. He stated that he wanted to establish
    a sugar factory within the borders of our municipality. Our analysts state that
    if the right techniques are used in the long term, we can go a long way in sugar
    production. At the same time, we can lower the unemployment rate. Shall we let
    him set up a factory?
