  dialogue: Hello President!  You came here after an unfortunate event. As you know...
    our previous mayor passed away. Our people are very upset and there is only one
    month left until the election. In this short period, someone had to run the municipality. 
    The moment I found out that you were going to be mayor temporarily until a new
    mayor was elected, I prepared everything! Your computer is completely up to date,
    no viruses. All you have to do is to indicate your preferences by swiping the
    suggestions that I will send you via e-mail to the right or left of the screen.
    Remember, municipal business is a business of balance. While your choices may
    be good for some areas and bad for others, the important thing is to keep them
    all in balance.  And without forgetting, you can follow the latest developments
    from the news tab and be informed about the results of your decisions!  Congratulations
    on your new temporary position and good luck!
